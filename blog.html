                        <h3>Output #1: Infographics</h3>
                        <p>During the PC and VLSI era, I learned how personal computers and microchip technology revolutionized the world. Personal computers became more accessible, and key figures like Steve Jobs and Bill Gates made them essential to daily life. VLSI technology made computers faster, smaller, and more affordable, laying the foundation for modern electronics.</p>

                            <p>This era showed me how these innovations impacted society and industries. PCs changed how we work, communicate, and learn, while VLSI enabled the development of portable devices like smartphones. Overall, it taught me how technological advancements can shape the future and drive global change.</p>

                        <h3>Output #2: Cybercrime Case Activity</h3>
                        <p>In our research on cybercrime, we looked into the case of Pastor Apollo Quiboloy, a well-known religious leader in the Philippines, who was involved in child soliciting and abuse. Quiboloy's group was accused of exploiting and abusing children, with some victims trafficked under the false pretense of religious activities. The case gained attention when survivors shared their stories of abuse, leading to investigations.</p>

                        <p>This case shows how cybercrime can involve online platforms in child exploitation, making it harder for authorities to track. It highlights the need for stronger laws and better protection for children against online abuse and trafficking.</p>

                        <h3>Output #3: Wireframe Creation</h3>
                        <p>
                            As part of developing my portfolio website, the first step I took was to create a wireframe. The wireframe was a simple visual guide that outlined the structure of the webpage, showing where the content, navigation, and interface elements would be placed. It didn’t focus on things like colors or images, but instead helped me organize the layout of the site. Creating the wireframe was important because it allowed me to clearly structure my ideas before diving into coding. It also helped me visualize the flow of the website and communicate my layout to others before development began.</p>
                            

                           <p> Through this process, I learned how essential planning is before starting any actual work on a website. While I initially followed the wireframe, I ended up making changes along the way because I wanted to improve the user experience and refine my design. This taught me that being flexible and open to adjustments during development is important, even if the wireframe is a guide. Ultimately, it helped me realize that a wireframe is a helpful starting point, but the design process is always evolving as ideas develop.</p>

                        <h3>Output #4: HTML Activity</h3>
                        <p>Through this first HTML activity, I learned how to create a basic webpage. I discovered the importance of using different tags to organize information, like headings for titles and lists for things I love and my pet peeves. It was exciting to see my ideas come to life on the screen. I also realized that even simple code can create something meaningful. This experience taught me that learning new skills takes practice, but it can be fun and rewarding. I’m excited to keep exploring HTML and improve my web development skills!</p>

                        <h3>Output #5: Cross Analysis</h3>
                        <p>In this activity, I learned about the features and importance of Cloud Computing, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and the Internet of Things (IoT). Cloud Computing allows us to store and access data online, making it easier to use tools like Google Drive without needing extra hardware. AI helps make our lives easier by providing smart solutions in many areas. IoT connects devices like phones and appliances to the internet so they can share data and communicate.</p>
                        <p>I also realized that these technologies work together. IoT devices create data, which is stored in the cloud. AI then analyzes the data to find patterns and make predictions. Together, they help create smarter and more efficient systems. Overall, understanding these trends is important for living a productive and innovative life.</p>

                    <h3>My Favorite Lesson</h3>
                    <p>Basic HTML & CSS became one of my favorite lessons because they were the foundation that opened up the world of web development for me. At first, I was a little intimidated by the idea of coding a website, but when I learned HTML, I realized it's like building the structure of a house — it's all about setting up the right foundation. I was able to create simple web pages by organizing content with headings, paragraphs, and lists. It was exciting to see my ideas take shape on the screen!</p>
                        
                    <p>CSS, on the other hand, helped me make those pages look good. I learned how to change colors, fonts, and even the layout of the page. It felt like I was an artist, making my work visually appealing while still using just a few lines of code. What made it even better was that HTML and CSS are so easy to understand — they're the perfect starting point for anyone who wants to learn web development.</p>
                        
                    <p>The best part? It was incredibly rewarding to see the web pages I created come to life. From something as simple as a few tags in HTML to making the page look beautiful with CSS, I felt like I was making real progress. Basic HTML & CSS gave me the confidence to dive deeper into coding and start exploring more advanced techniques. It’s my favorite because it’s where everything started, and I know that these skills will always be the building blocks of everything I create in the future.</p>
